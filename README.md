# ALX LOW-LEVEL-PROGRAMMING: THE C PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

## This Repository contains various Learning projects embarked on the journey of learning C. It is very well structured, taking us from the very basics to more advanced concepts and applications of the learnt concepts.

## A number of the Tasks, involved recreating many of the functions in the standard library header files to better understand how to use knowledge learnt to implement various functions to meet required needs, including but not limited to functions for manipulating pointers, arrays and strings
